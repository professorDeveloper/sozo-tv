Sozo is crafted with a perfect blend of simplicity and state-of-the-art elegance. It is designed as an Anilist only client, offering users the ability to stream and download their favorite Anime & Manga.

The name Sozo (meaning "creation" or "imagination" in Japanese) represents innovation and artistry in the anime world. While we think this is the best open-source anime app for Android, we encourage you to try it out yourself and decide!
