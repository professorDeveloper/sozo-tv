1
00:00:22,892 --> 00:00:25,135
Come on, let's say good night to your brother.

2
00:00:29,911 --> 00:00:34,167
- 'Night Sam.
- Good night, love.

3
00:00:35,783 --> 00:00:37,168
Hey ! Dean.

4
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:39,517
- Daddy !
- Hey ! buddy.

5
00:00:39,613 --> 00:00:42,350
What do you think ?
Sam is ready to touch around football yet ?

6
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,214
- No, daddy.
- No ?

7
00:00:44,261 --> 00:00:45,945
- You got him ?
- I got him.

8
00:00:48,426 --> 00:00:50,140
Sweet dreams, Sammy.

9
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:22,496
- John ?

10
00:01:43,392 --> 00:01:46,190
John, is he hungry ?

11
00:01:48,328 --> 00:01:49,148
Okay.

12
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,520
Sammy !

13
00:02:40,031 --> 00:02:40,748
Mary !

14
00:02:41,896 --> 00:02:42,716
Mary !

15
00:02:47,497 --> 00:02:48,259
Mary !

16
00:02:55,983 --> 00:02:57,228
Hey, Sammy.

17
00:02:58,962 --> 00:03:00,075
Okay ?

18
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:18,473
Mary !

19
00:03:32,249 --> 00:03:33,143
Daddy !

20
00:03:33,236 --> 00:03:34,900
Take your brother outside as fast as you can !

21
00:03:35,001 --> 00:03:36,314
Don't look back !

22
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,716
Now, Dean !
Go !

23
00:03:53,404 --> 00:03:54,532
It's okay, Sam.

24
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,848
I got it.
I got it.

25
00:04:11,805 --> 00:04:12,450
Here.

26
00:04:28,553 --> 00:04:30,590
Stay back.
You have to stay back.

27
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,230
Sam !

28
00:04:47,802 --> 00:04:49,499
Get a move on, would ya ?

29
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,605
We were supposed to be there
like 15 minutes ago.

30
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,385
Sam, you coming or what ?

31
00:04:54,977 --> 00:04:58,666
Do I have to ?
Yes. It'll be fun.

32
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,395
And where's your costume ?

33
00:05:04,034 --> 00:05:06,403
You know how I feel
about Halloween.

34
00:05:12,859 --> 00:05:15,720
So here's to Sam and his awesome LSAT* victory.

35
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:15,720
*LSAT = Law School Admission Test

36
00:05:15,827 --> 00:05:17,300
All right, all right.
It's not that big a deal.

37
00:05:17,301 --> 00:05:19,912
Yeah, he acts all humble, but he scored a 174.

38
00:05:21,178 --> 00:05:23,417
- Is that good ?
- Scary good.

39
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:25,785
See, there you go.
You are a first-round draft pick.

40
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,156
You can go to any law school you want.

41
00:05:28,157 --> 00:05:30,426
Actually, I got an interview here monday.

42
00:05:30,895 --> 00:05:34,050
If it goes okay, I think I got
a shot at a full ride next year.

43
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:35,980
Hey, it's gonna go great.

44
00:05:37,392 --> 00:05:38,117
It better.

45
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:40,560
How does it feel to be
the golden boy in your family ?

46
00:05:40,566 --> 00:05:41,625
They don't know.

47
00:05:41,658 --> 00:05:44,455
No ? I would be gloating.
Why not ?

48
00:05:44,505 --> 00:05:46,529
'Cause we're not exactly the Bradys*.

49
00:05:46,531 --> 00:05:46,531
*From the show "The Brady Bunch".

50
00:05:46,581 --> 00:05:48,932
I'm not exactly the Huxtables*.
More shots ?

51
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:48,933
*The Huxtables from The Cosby Show.

52
00:05:48,964 --> 00:05:50,725
- No.
- No. No.
- No !

53
00:05:50,755 --> 00:05:54,804
Seriously, I'm proud of you, and you're gonna
knock them dead on monday.

54
00:05:54,805 --> 00:05:56,226
You're gonna get that full ride.

55
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:57,593
I know it.

56
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,816
What would I do without you ?

57
00:05:59,924 --> 00:06:01,312
Crash and burn.

58
00:07:03,274 --> 00:07:05,301
Whoa ! Easy, tiger.

59
00:07:05,922 --> 00:07:06,727
Dean ?

60
00:07:08,352 --> 00:07:09,815
You scared the crap out of me.

61
00:07:09,815 --> 00:07:11,265
That's cause you're out of practice.

62
00:07:13,637 --> 00:07:14,633
Or not.

63
00:07:15,145 --> 00:07:16,285
Get off of me.

64
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,319
Dean, what the hell are you doing here ?

65
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:20,526
I was looking for a beer.

66
00:07:21,043 --> 00:07:22,880
What the hell are you doing here ?

67
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,685
Ok, all right, we got to talk.

68
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,244
- The phone ?
- If I'd called would you picked up ?

69
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:29,607
Sam ?

70
00:07:30,945 --> 00:07:33,011
Jess, hey.

71
00:07:34,338 --> 00:07:36,346
Dean, this is my girlfriend, Jessica.

72
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,911
Wait.
Your brother Dean ?

73
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,202
I love the Smurfs.

74
00:07:40,772 --> 00:07:44,517
You know, I got to tell you.
You are completely out of my brother's league.

75
00:07:44,623 --> 00:07:46,076
Just let me put something on.

76
00:07:46,123 --> 00:07:49,931
No, no.
No, I wouldn't dream of it, seriously.

77
00:07:50,967 --> 00:07:54,090
Anyway, I got to borrow your boyfriend here,
talk about some private family business, but

78
00:07:54,091 --> 00:07:55,282
nice meeting you.

79
00:07:56,915 --> 00:07:57,893
No.

80
00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:01,930
No, whatever you want to say,
you can say it in front of her.

81
00:08:02,531 --> 00:08:03,534
Okay.

82
00:08:05,082 --> 00:08:07,067
Dad hasn't been home in a few days.

83
00:08:08,036 --> 00:08:12,330
So ? He's working overtime on a "Miller Time"* shift.
He'll stumble back in sooner or later.

84
00:08:12,331 --> 00:08:12,331
*"Miller Time" is a slogan for a beer.

85
00:08:13,346 --> 00:08:15,864
Dad's on a hunting trip,

86
00:08:15,865 --> 00:08:18,286
and he hasn't been home in a few days.

87
00:08:23,218 --> 00:08:24,378
Jess, excuse us.

88
00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:27,986
We have to go outside.

89
00:08:28,212 --> 00:08:32,899
I mean, come on, you can't just break in the middle of the night
and expect me to hit the road with you.

90
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,985
You're not hearing me, Sammy.
Dad's missing.

91
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,809
I need you to help me find him.

92
00:08:36,597 --> 00:08:39,928
You remember the poltergeist in Amherst,
or the devil's gates in Clifton ?

93
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,341
He was missing then, too.
He's always missing, and he's always fine.

94
00:08:43,342 --> 00:08:45,703
Not for this long.
Now, are you gonna come with me or not ?

95
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,993
I'm not.

96
00:08:47,383 --> 00:08:48,100
Why not ?

97
00:08:48,148 --> 00:08:50,450
I swore I was done hunting.
For good.

98
00:08:50,705 --> 00:08:53,462
- Come on, it wasn't easy, but it wasn't that bad.
- Yeah ?

99
00:08:54,084 --> 00:08:57,279
When I told dad I was scared of the thing in my closet,
he gave me a .45.

100
00:08:57,311 --> 00:08:58,411
What was he supposed to do ?

101
00:08:58,445 --> 00:09:00,374
I was 9 years old.

102
00:09:01,103 --> 00:09:03,374
He was supposed to say:
"Don't be afraid of the dark."

103
00:09:03,432 --> 00:09:05,022
"Don't be afraid of the dark" ?
Are you kidding me ?

104
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,180
Of course, you should be afraid.
You know what's out there.

105
00:09:07,221 --> 00:09:09,877
Yeah I know but still...
The way we grew up after mom was killed

106
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:12,440
and dad's obsession to find the thing that killed her.

107
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,923
But we still haven't found the damn thing.

108
00:09:15,053 --> 00:09:16,599
So we kill everything we can find.

109
00:09:16,731 --> 00:09:19,033
Save a lot of people doing it, too.

110
00:09:21,617 --> 00:09:23,370
You think mom would have wanted this for us ?

111
00:09:25,369 --> 00:09:29,123
The weapon training and melting the silver into bullets ?

112
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,752
Man, Dean, we were raised like warriors.

113
00:09:31,778 --> 00:09:32,819
So, what are you gonna do ?

114
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:35,763
Are you just gonna live some normal, apple-pie life ?

115
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,375
Is that it ?

116
00:09:36,512 --> 00:09:38,831
No, not normal.
Safe.

117
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:41,116
And that's why you ran away.

118
00:09:44,526 --> 00:09:46,027
I was just going to college.

119
00:09:46,028 --> 00:09:49,313
It was dad who said if I was gonna go,
I should stay gone.

120
00:09:50,836 --> 00:09:51,895
And that's what I'm doing.

121
00:09:51,914 --> 00:09:55,857
Dad's in real trouble right now
if he's not dead already.
I can feel it.

122
00:09:58,884 --> 00:10:00,190
I can't do this alone.

123
00:10:00,574 --> 00:10:01,809
Yes, you can.

124
00:10:02,194 --> 00:10:04,935
Yeah.
Well, I don't want to.

125
00:10:13,381 --> 00:10:14,784
What was he hunting ?

126
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:23,892
All right. Let's see.
Where the hell did I put that thing ?

127
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,934
So when dad left,
why didn't you go with him ?

128
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,697
I was working my own gig...
This voodoo thing down in New Orleans.

129
00:10:30,074 --> 00:10:32,727
Dad let you go on a hunting trip by yourself ?

130
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,554
I'm 26, dude.

131
00:10:35,965 --> 00:10:37,694
All right, here we go.

132
00:10:37,954 --> 00:10:42,232
So dad was checking out this two-lane blacktop
just outside of Jericho, California.

133
00:10:42,331 --> 00:10:43,735
About a month ago, this guy...

134
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,145
They found his car, but he'd vanished.
Completely M.I.A.*

135
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:47,146
*M.I.A. = Missing In Action

136
00:10:47,974 --> 00:10:49,536
So maybe he was kidnapped.

137
00:10:49,575 --> 00:10:51,593
Yeah, well, here's another one in April,

138
00:10:51,737 --> 00:10:57,205
another one in December '04, '03, '98, '92...
10 of them over the past 20 years...

139
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,278
All men, all same 5-mile stretch of road.

140
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,447
Started happening more and more, so

141
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,978
dad went to go dig around.

142
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,754
That was about three weeks ago.

143
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,550
I hadn't heard from him since,
which is bad enough,

144
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,868
and then I get this voice mail yesterday.

145
00:11:14,411 --> 00:11:18,447
<i>Dean, something is starting to happen.
I think it's serious.

146
00:11:18,535 --> 00:11:20,472
<i>I need to try to figure out what's going on.

147
00:11:24,161 --> 00:11:27,422
<i>Be very careful, Dean.
We're all in danger.

148
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,623
You know there's EVP* on that ?

149
00:11:29,624 --> 00:11:29,624
*EVP = Electronic Voice Phenomenon

150
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:32,551
Not bad, Sammy.
Kind of like riding a bike, isn't it ?

151
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:36,354
All right.
I slowed the message down and ran it through a goldwave,

152
00:11:36,385 --> 00:11:38,122
took out the hiss,
and this is what I got.

153
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:43,263
<i>I can never go home.

154
00:11:45,613 --> 00:11:47,209
Never go home.

155
00:11:52,986 --> 00:11:56,882
You know, in almost two years, I've never bothered you,
never asked you for a thing.

156
00:12:03,984 --> 00:12:06,565
All right, I'll go.

157
00:12:07,473 --> 00:12:08,959
I'll help you find him,

158
00:12:09,183 --> 00:12:11,092
but I have to get back first thing Monday.

159
00:12:11,452 --> 00:12:12,422
Just wait here.

160
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,476
What's first thing monday ?

161
00:12:15,951 --> 00:12:17,578
I've this...

162
00:12:19,194 --> 00:12:20,086
I have an interview.

163
00:12:20,102 --> 00:12:21,911
What ? A job interview ?
Skip it.

164
00:12:23,718 --> 00:12:28,011
It's a law-school interview,
and it's my whole future on a plate.

165
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,007
Law school ?

166
00:12:29,887 --> 00:12:31,545
So we got a deal or not ?

167
00:12:35,805 --> 00:12:37,323
Wait, you're taking off ?

168
00:12:37,603 --> 00:12:39,074
Is this about your dad ?
Is he all right ?

169
00:12:39,215 --> 00:12:41,640
Yeah. You know,
just a little family drama.

170
00:12:42,113 --> 00:12:44,754
But your brother said he was on some kind of hunting trip.

171
00:12:44,809 --> 00:12:47,448
Yeah, he's just deer hunting up at the cabin,

172
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,847
and he's probably got Jim, Jack, and Jose along with him.

173
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,509
We're just gonna go bring him back.

174
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:53,601
What about the interview ?

175
00:12:54,392 --> 00:12:55,550
I'll make the interview.

176
00:12:55,664 --> 00:12:57,094
This is only for a couple days.

177
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,916
Sam, I mean, please.
Just stop for a second.

178
00:13:00,858 --> 00:13:01,938
You're sure you're okay ?

179
00:13:02,834 --> 00:13:03,914
I'm fine

180
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,033
It's just...
You want even talk about your family

181
00:13:08,486 --> 00:13:11,492
and now you're taking off the middle of the night
to spend the week-end with them

182
00:13:11,711 --> 00:13:14,558
And with Monday coming up...
It's just not kind of your style.

183
00:13:14,603 --> 00:13:16,914
Hey, everything's gonna be okay.

184
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:19,852
I would be back in time, I promise.

185
00:13:23,568 --> 00:13:25,091
At least tell me where you're going !

186
00:13:35,163 --> 00:13:36,915
Amy, I can't come over tonight.

187
00:13:37,887 --> 00:13:40,500
Because I got work in the morning, that's why.

188
00:13:42,064 --> 00:13:44,364
Okay, I miss it, my dad's gonna have my ass.

189
00:13:49,978 --> 00:13:51,714
Hey, uh, Amy, let me call you back.

190
00:14:05,054 --> 00:14:06,525
Car trouble or something ?

191
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:13,743
Take me home.

192
00:14:15,261 --> 00:14:16,512
Sure, get in.

193
00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:35,205
So where do you live ?

194
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:40,744
At the end of Breckenridge Road.

195
00:14:42,094 --> 00:14:45,161
You're coming from a Halloween party or something ?

196
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,847
You know, um, a girl like you
really shouldn't be alone out here.

197
00:15:04,157 --> 00:15:05,894
I'm with you.

198
00:15:17,412 --> 00:15:19,477
Do you think I'm pretty ?

199
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,048
Will you come home with me ?

200
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:29,114
Um...Hell, yeah.

201
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:51,115
Come on.
You don't live here.

202
00:15:52,616 --> 00:15:54,070
I can never go home

203
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:58,482
What ? What are you talking about ?
Nobody lives here.

204
00:15:58,846 --> 00:16:00,583
Huh, where do you live ?

205
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,318
That's good.

206
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:11,634
Joke's over, okay ?

207
00:16:14,996 --> 00:16:16,545
You want me to leave ?

208
00:16:36,372 --> 00:16:37,326
Hello ?

209
00:16:44,765 --> 00:16:46,235
Hello ?

210
00:17:43,567 --> 00:17:45,773
Hey. You want breakfast ?

211
00:17:46,263 --> 00:17:47,374
No, thanks.

212
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,255
So how'd you pay for that stuff ?
You and dad still running credit-card scams ?

213
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:55,702
Yeah, well, hunting ain't exactly a pro-ball career.

214
00:17:57,266 --> 00:17:59,836
Besides, all we do is apply.
It's not our fault they send us the cards.

215
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:04,156
Yeah, and what names did you write
on the application this time ?

216
00:18:04,224 --> 00:18:09,875
Uh... Bert Aframian and his son, Hector.
Scored two cards out of the deal.

217
00:18:09,969 --> 00:18:11,463
Sounds about right.

218
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,583
I swear, man,you got to update
your cassette-tape collection.

219
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,375
Why ?

220
00:18:15,516 --> 00:18:17,479
Well, for one...
They're cassette tapes.

221
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,480
And two...

222
00:18:18,481 --> 00:18:22,668
Black Sabbath, Motorhead, Metallica ?

223
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:25,727
It's the greatest hits of mullet rock.

224
00:18:25,967 --> 00:18:28,261
House rules, Sammy...
driver picks the music,

225
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,912
shotgun shuts his cake hole.

226
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:33,308
Yo Sammy is a chubby 12-year-old.
It's...

227
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,094
Sorry, I can't hear you.
The music's too loud.

228
00:18:53,729 --> 00:18:54,941
Thank you.

229
00:18:56,151 --> 00:18:59,047
All right. So there's no one matching dad
at the hospital or morgue.

230
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,339
So that's something, I guess.

231
00:19:03,697 --> 00:19:04,729
Check it out.

232
00:19:28,428 --> 00:19:29,398
Let's go.

233
00:19:33,459 --> 00:19:35,212
Did you guys find anything ?

234
00:19:35,243 --> 00:19:37,918
No !
Nothing !

235
00:19:42,805 --> 00:19:46,002
No sign of struggle, no footprints,
no fingerprints...

236
00:19:46,003 --> 00:19:47,003
Spotless.
It's almost too clean.

237
00:19:47,879 --> 00:19:49,504
So this kid, Troy...

238
00:19:49,505 --> 00:19:51,503
- He's dating your daughter, isn't he ?
- Ya.

239
00:19:51,504 --> 00:19:52,587
How's Amy doing ?

240
00:19:52,697 --> 00:19:54,746
She's been putting up missing posters downtown.

241
00:19:55,841 --> 00:19:58,579
You had another one like this last month, didn't you ?

242
00:19:59,768 --> 00:20:00,941
And who are you ?

243
00:20:01,489 --> 00:20:02,928
Federal marshals.

244
00:20:04,466 --> 00:20:06,594
You two are a little young for marshals, aren't you ?

245
00:20:06,782 --> 00:20:08,440
Thanks, that's awfully kind of you.

246
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:10,933
You did have another one just like this, correct ?

247
00:20:11,089 --> 00:20:11,840
Yeah, that's right,

248
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,359
about a mile up the road.
There have been others before that.

249
00:20:14,411 --> 00:20:17,118
So this victim...
You knew him ?

250
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:19,871
A town like this, everybody knows everybody.

251
00:20:19,934 --> 00:20:22,719
Any connection between the victims
besides that they're all men ?

252
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,688
No. Not so far as we can tell.

253
00:20:25,048 --> 00:20:26,096
So what's the theory ?

254
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:27,549
Honestly, we don't know...

255
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,971
Serial murderer, kidnapping ring.

256
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:34,080
Well, that is exactly the kind of crack police work
I'd expect out of you guys.

257
00:20:34,538 --> 00:20:36,525
Thank you for your time.

258
00:20:36,994 --> 00:20:38,762
Gentlemen.

259
00:20:47,253 --> 00:20:48,268
What was that for ?

260
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,895
- Why do you have to step on my foot ?
- Why do you have to talk to police like that ?

261
00:20:51,105 --> 00:20:53,514
Come on.
They don't really know what's going on.

262
00:20:53,622 --> 00:20:54,782
We're all alone on this.

263
00:20:54,783 --> 00:20:57,871
If we're gonna find dad,
we've got to get to the bottom of this thing ourselves.

264
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,936
Can I help you boys ?

265
00:21:02,448 --> 00:21:04,248
No, sir. We were just leaving.

266
00:21:04,249 --> 00:21:06,544
Agent Mulder, agent Scully.

267
00:21:14,934 --> 00:21:16,264
I'll bet you that's her.

268
00:21:16,562 --> 00:21:17,469
Yeah.

269
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,161
- You must be Amy.
- Yeah.

270
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,514
Troy told us about you. We're his uncles.
I'm Dean. This is Sammy.

271
00:21:24,749 --> 00:21:26,110
He never mentioned you to me.

272
00:21:26,689 --> 00:21:27,909
Well, that's Troy, I guess.

273
00:21:27,956 --> 00:21:29,659
We're not around much.
We're up in Modesto.

274
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:33,570
So we're looking for him, too,
and we're kind of asking around.

275
00:21:33,775 --> 00:21:35,965
- Hey, are you okay ?
- Yeah.

276
00:21:36,205 --> 00:21:38,411
Do you mind if we ask you a couple questions ?

277
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,150
I was on the phone with Troy.
He was driving home.

278
00:21:42,151 --> 00:21:47,004
He said he would call me right back,
and he never did.

279
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:49,560
He didn't say anything strange ?
Or out of the ordinary ?

280
00:21:49,706 --> 00:21:52,553
No, nothing I can remember.

281
00:21:53,997 --> 00:21:55,343
I like your necklace.

282
00:21:58,085 --> 00:21:59,321
Troy gave it to me.

283
00:21:59,968 --> 00:22:03,895
Mostly to scare my parents...
You know, the devil stuff.

284
00:22:06,371 --> 00:22:08,590
Actually it means just the opposite.

285
00:22:08,601 --> 00:22:11,338
A pentagram is a protection against evil.

286
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,444
Really powerfull,
I mean if you believe in a kind of thing.

287
00:22:14,589 --> 00:22:16,936
Ok, thank you, Unsolved Mysteries.

288
00:22:17,186 --> 00:22:18,390
Here's the deal, ladies...

289
00:22:18,391 --> 00:22:21,894
The way Troy disappeared...
Something's not right.

290
00:22:21,895 --> 00:22:23,998
So if you've heard anything...

291
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:27,199
What is it ?

292
00:22:27,887 --> 00:22:28,817
Well, it's just...

293
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,846
I mean, with all these guys going missing, people talk.

294
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,081
What do they talk about ?

295
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,968
It's kind of this local legend.

296
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:43,865
This one girl, she got murdered out
on Centennial like decades ago.

297
00:22:44,469 --> 00:22:47,113
Well, supposedly, she's still out there.

298
00:22:47,509 --> 00:22:50,899
She hitchhikes, and whoever picks her up...

299
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,072
Well, they disappear forever.

300
00:23:11,172 --> 00:23:13,002
- Let me try.
- I got it.

301
00:23:14,363 --> 00:23:15,208
Dude.

302
00:23:16,725 --> 00:23:18,884
You're such a control freak.

303
00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:22,607
- So angry spirits are born out of violent death, right ?
- Yeah

304
00:23:22,983 --> 00:23:24,391
Maybe it's not murder.

305
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:38,613
This was 1981.
Constance Welch, 24 years old,
jumps off Sylvania Bridge, drowns in the river.

306
00:23:38,644 --> 00:23:40,401
- Does it say why she did it ?
- Yeah.

307
00:23:40,792 --> 00:23:41,355
What ?

308
00:23:42,091 --> 00:23:44,442
An hour before they found her, she calls 911.

309
00:23:44,505 --> 00:23:47,656
Her two little kids are in the bathtub.
She leaves them alone for a minute,

310
00:23:47,657 --> 00:23:48,829
and when she comes back,

311
00:23:48,901 --> 00:23:50,153
they aren't breathing.

312
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:51,850
Both died.

313
00:23:52,841 --> 00:23:55,428
"Our babies were gone,
and Constance just couldn't bear it,"

314
00:23:55,429 --> 00:23:56,429
said husband, Joseph Welch.

315
00:23:58,807 --> 00:24:00,904
That bridge look familiar to you ?

316
00:24:05,899 --> 00:24:08,903
So this is where Constance took the swan dive.

317
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,051
So you think dad would have been here ?

318
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:14,555
Well, he's chasing the same story, and we're chasing him.

319
00:24:15,968 --> 00:24:17,314
Okay, so now what ?

320
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:20,849
Now we keep digging till we find him.
It might take a while.

321
00:24:21,047 --> 00:24:24,661
Dean, I told you I've got to get back by...
- Monday.

322
00:24:25,803 --> 00:24:27,571
Right.
The interview.

323
00:24:27,618 --> 00:24:29,198
Yeah.
Yeah, I forgot.

324
00:24:29,861 --> 00:24:31,707
You're really serious about this, aren't you ?

325
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:34,914
You think you're just gonna become some lawyer,

326
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,541
marry your girl ?

327
00:24:36,604 --> 00:24:37,746
Maybe.
Why not ?

328
00:24:37,954 --> 00:24:41,334
Does Jessica know the truth about you ?
Does she know about the things you've done ?

329
00:24:41,537 --> 00:24:43,305
No, and she's not ever going to know.

330
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,542
Well, that's healthy.

331
00:24:45,844 --> 00:24:50,365
You can pretend all you want, Sammy, but sooner or later
you're gonna have to face up to who you really are.

332
00:24:50,792 --> 00:24:51,551
Who is that ?

333
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,057
- One of us.
- No !

334
00:24:53,186 --> 00:24:55,727
I'm not like you. This is not going to be my life.

335
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:58,818
- Well, you have a responsibility.
- To dad ?

336
00:24:58,146 --> 00:24:59,851
And his crusade ?

337
00:25:00,226 --> 00:25:03,277
If it weren't for pictures,
I wouldn't even know what mom looks like.

338
00:25:03,672 --> 00:25:05,049
What difference would it make ?

339
00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:07,443
Even if we do find the thing that killed her,

340
00:25:08,241 --> 00:25:11,026
mom's gone, and she isn't coming back.

341
00:25:17,269 --> 00:25:19,615
Don't talk about her like that.

342
00:25:28,812 --> 00:25:29,735
Sam.

343
00:25:42,561 --> 00:25:44,360
- Where'd she go ?
- I don't know.

344
00:25:48,719 --> 00:25:52,364
What the...?
Who's driving your car ?

345
00:26:00,048 --> 00:26:02,895
Come on, Dean.
Let's go ! Go !

346
00:26:26,527 --> 00:26:27,387
Dean !

347
00:26:28,808 --> 00:26:29,481
Dean !

348
00:26:32,305 --> 00:26:33,150
What ?!

349
00:26:36,916 --> 00:26:39,091
Hey, are you all right ?

350
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,203
I'm super.

351
00:26:46,911 --> 00:26:48,225
Car all right ?

352
00:26:48,428 --> 00:26:51,025
Yeah, whatever she did to it,
it seems all right now.

353
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,404
That Constance chick...
What a bitch !

354
00:26:53,638 --> 00:26:56,407
Well, she doesn't want us digging around,
that's for sure.

355
00:26:58,368 --> 00:27:00,652
So where's the trail go from here, genius ?

356
00:27:06,144 --> 00:27:07,724
You smell like a toilet.

357
00:27:10,736 --> 00:27:11,956
One room, please.

358
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,714
You guys having a reunion or something ?

359
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:18,684
What do you mean ?

360
00:27:19,017 --> 00:27:23,444
That other guy, Bert Aframian.
He came in and bought out a room for the whole month.

361
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,671
I don't think he's been here for a couple days at least.

362
00:27:58,835 --> 00:28:01,494
Salt, cat's-eye shells...

363
00:28:01,917 --> 00:28:05,677
He was worried,
trying to keep something from coming in.

364
00:28:08,696 --> 00:28:09,807
What do you got here ?

365
00:28:10,275 --> 00:28:12,888
Centennial Highway victims.

366
00:28:14,437 --> 00:28:15,767
I don't get it.

367
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:20,241
I mean, different men, different jobs, age, ethnicities.

368
00:28:20,951 --> 00:28:22,719
There's always a connection, right ?

369
00:28:23,548 --> 00:28:24,972
What do these guys have in common ?

370
00:28:40,101 --> 00:28:41,431
Dad figured it out.

371
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,952
What do you mean ?

372
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,069
He found the same article we did.

373
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:48,484
Constance Welch.
She's a woman in white.

374
00:28:51,459 --> 00:28:52,945
You sly dogs.

375
00:28:53,242 --> 00:28:56,606
All right, so if we're dealing with a woman in white,
dad would have found the corpse and destroyed it.

376
00:28:56,794 --> 00:28:58,390
She might have another weakness.

377
00:28:58,914 --> 00:29:01,441
No, dad would want to make sure.
He'd dig her up.

378
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,864
Does it say where she's buried ?

379
00:29:03,288 --> 00:29:05,087
No, not that I can tell.

380
00:29:05,604 --> 00:29:07,810
If I were dad, though,
I'd go ask her husband,

381
00:29:08,232 --> 00:29:09,484
if he's still alive.

382
00:29:16,053 --> 00:29:19,198
All right, why don't you see if you can find an address ?
I'm gonna get cleaned up.

383
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:24,537
Hey, Dean, what I said earlier about mom and dad...
I'm sorry.

384
00:29:25,366 --> 00:29:26,789
No chick-flick moments.

385
00:29:27,968 --> 00:29:29,767
All right... jerk.

386
00:29:30,909 --> 00:29:31,785
Bitch.

387
00:29:49,107 --> 00:29:52,533
<i>Hey, it's me.
It's about 10:20...

388
00:29:53,049 --> 00:29:57,248
Hey, man. I'm starving.
I'm gonna grab a little something to eat
at that diner down the street.

389
00:29:57,249 --> 00:29:58,557
You want anything ?

390
00:29:58,864 --> 00:29:59,433
No.

391
00:29:59,433 --> 00:30:00,730
Aframian's buying.

392
00:30:18,226 --> 00:30:20,761
<i>So come home soon, okay ?
I love you.

393
00:30:23,624 --> 00:30:24,156
What ?

394
00:30:24,395 --> 00:30:25,725
Dude, five-O.
Take off.

395
00:30:26,194 --> 00:30:27,211
What about you ?

396
00:30:27,477 --> 00:30:30,074
Uh, they kind of spotted me.
Go find dad.

397
00:30:32,046 --> 00:30:33,235
Problem, officers ?

398
00:30:33,407 --> 00:30:34,658
Where's your partner ?

399
00:30:34,907 --> 00:30:36,957
Partner ? What ?
What partner ?

400
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:47,996
So fake U.S. Marshal, fake credit cards.

401
00:30:48,262 --> 00:30:49,717
You got anything that's real ?

402
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,172
My boobs.

403
00:30:53,104 --> 00:30:55,247
You have the right to remain silent.

404
00:30:58,287 --> 00:31:00,477
So you want to give us your real name ?

405
00:31:00,827 --> 00:31:04,081
I told you.
It's Nugent, Ted Nugent.

406
00:31:06,271 --> 00:31:09,275
I'm not sure you realize just how much trouble you're in here.

407
00:31:09,276 --> 00:31:13,629
We're talking, like, misdemeanor kind of trouble
or "squeal like a pig" trouble ?

408
00:31:13,989 --> 00:31:16,743
You got the faces of 10 missing persons taped to your wall,

409
00:31:17,155 --> 00:31:20,065
along with a whole lot of satanic mumbo jumbo.

410
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,380
Boy, you are officially a suspect.

411
00:31:22,542 --> 00:31:26,516
That makes sense
'cause when the first one went missing in '82, I was 3.

412
00:31:27,063 --> 00:31:29,973
I know you got partners.
One of them's an older guy.

413
00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:32,727
Maybe he started the whole thing.

414
00:31:34,406 --> 00:31:36,612
So tell me, Dean...

415
00:31:39,011 --> 00:31:39,934
is this his ?

416
00:31:47,511 --> 00:31:49,013
I thought that might be your name.

417
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,186
See, I leafed through this,

418
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,777
what little I could make out.
I mean, it's nine kinds of crazy,

419
00:31:57,377 --> 00:31:59,098
but I found this, too.

420
00:32:00,174 --> 00:32:05,869
Now, you're staying right here
till you tell me exactly what the hell that means.

421
00:32:18,162 --> 00:32:21,291
- Hi, uh, are you Joseph Welch ?
- Yeah.

422
00:32:22,177 --> 00:32:23,918
Yeah, he was older, but that's him.

423
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,367
He came by three or four days ago, said he was a reporter.

424
00:32:27,726 --> 00:32:30,198
That's right.
We're working on a story together.

425
00:32:31,447 --> 00:32:35,468
Well, I don't know
what the hell kind of story you're working on...
the questions he asked me.

426
00:32:35,546 --> 00:32:37,376
About your late wife, Constance.

427
00:32:38,346 --> 00:32:40,083
He asked me where she was buried.

428
00:32:40,933 --> 00:32:42,544
And where is that again ?

429
00:32:43,154 --> 00:32:44,672
What ?
I got to go through these twice ?

430
00:32:44,969 --> 00:32:47,314
It's fact checking, if you don't mind.

431
00:32:49,942 --> 00:32:53,353
In a plot behind my old place over on Breckenridge.

432
00:32:53,968 --> 00:32:55,517
Why did you move ?

433
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:00,382
I'm not gonna live in the house where my children died.

434
00:33:03,098 --> 00:33:05,179
Mr. Welch, did you ever marry again ?

435
00:33:05,304 --> 00:33:08,918
No way.
Constance... She was the love of my life,

436
00:33:10,512 --> 00:33:12,343
prettiest woman I ever known.

437
00:33:12,562 --> 00:33:14,001
So you had a happy marriage ?

438
00:33:17,518 --> 00:33:18,316
Definitely.

439
00:33:21,398 --> 00:33:24,120
Well, that should do it.
Thanks for your time.

440
00:33:34,706 --> 00:33:37,544
Mr. Welch, you ever hear of a woman in white ?

441
00:33:37,726 --> 00:33:38,461
A what ?

442
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:42,075
A woman in white or sometimes a weeping woman.

443
00:33:43,112 --> 00:33:44,098
It's a ghost story.

444
00:33:44,321 --> 00:33:47,623
Well, it's more of a phenomenon, really.

445
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:51,399
They're spirits.
They've been sighted for hundreds of years,

446
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:55,973
dozens of places in Hawaii and Mexico,
lately in Arizona, Indiana.

447
00:33:56,014 --> 00:33:57,892
All these are different women, you understand,

448
00:33:58,178 --> 00:34:00,055
but all share the same story.

449
00:34:00,994 --> 00:34:04,159
Boy, I don't care much for nonsense.

450
00:34:04,316 --> 00:34:05,677
You see, when they were alive,

451
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,154
their husbands were unfaithful to them,

452
00:34:09,061 --> 00:34:10,141
and these women,

453
00:34:10,501 --> 00:34:13,567
basically suffering from temporary insanity,
murdered their children.

454
00:34:15,237 --> 00:34:18,585
Then, once they realized what they had done,
they took their own lives.

455
00:34:18,882 --> 00:34:20,634
So now their spirits are cursed,

456
00:34:20,963 --> 00:34:22,981
walking back roads, waterways,

457
00:34:23,315 --> 00:34:26,381
and if they find an unfaithful man,
they kill him,

458
00:34:26,819 --> 00:34:28,556
and that man is never seen again.

459
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,669
You think...

460
00:34:32,826 --> 00:34:36,519
You think that has something to do with Constance,

461
00:34:37,145 --> 00:34:38,318
you smart ass ?

462
00:34:38,912 --> 00:34:40,054
You tell me.

463
00:34:43,479 --> 00:34:47,953
I mean, maybe...
Maybe I made some mistakes,

464
00:34:48,532 --> 00:34:50,206
but no matter what I did,

465
00:34:50,895 --> 00:34:53,633
Constance never would have killed her own children.

466
00:34:55,061 --> 00:34:57,158
Now, you get the hell out of here,

467
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,207
and you don't come back.

468
00:35:14,684 --> 00:35:16,655
I don't know how many times I got to tell you.

469
00:35:16,874 --> 00:35:18,486
It's my high-school locker combo.

470
00:35:18,913 --> 00:35:20,603
Are we gonna do this all night long ?

471
00:35:20,681 --> 00:35:23,763
We just got a 911.
Shots fired over at Whiteford Road.

472
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:27,236
Do you have to go to the bathroom ?

473
00:35:27,867 --> 00:35:28,509
No.

474
00:35:28,837 --> 00:35:29,901
Good.

475
00:36:19,892 --> 00:36:23,084
Fake 911 phone call, Sammy ?
That's pretty illegal.

476
00:36:23,365 --> 00:36:24,132
You're welcome.

477
00:36:24,226 --> 00:36:25,509
Listen, we got to talk

478
00:36:25,602 --> 00:36:28,345
Tell me about it.
So the husband was unfaithful.

479
00:36:28,439 --> 00:36:30,128
We are dealing with a woman in white.

480
00:36:30,206 --> 00:36:32,779
She's buried behind her old house.

481
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,000
Sammy, would you shut up for a second ?

482
00:36:34,044 --> 00:36:36,172
I can't figure out why he hasn't destroyed the corpse yet.

483
00:36:36,375 --> 00:36:38,816
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
He's gone.

484
00:36:39,212 --> 00:36:40,291
Dad left Jericho.

485
00:36:40,338 --> 00:36:42,184
What ?
How do you know ?

486
00:36:42,998 --> 00:36:43,811
I've got his journal.

487
00:36:43,999 --> 00:36:45,610
He doesn't go anywhere without that thing.

488
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:46,898
Well, he did this time.

489
00:36:46,961 --> 00:36:47,712
What's it say ?

490
00:36:47,743 --> 00:36:50,841
Same old ex-Marine crap
when he wants to let us know where he's going.

491
00:36:50,904 --> 00:36:51,712
Coordinates.

492
00:36:51,715 --> 00:36:52,715
Where to ?

493
00:36:52,715 --> 00:36:53,882
I'm not sure yet.

494
00:36:53,907 --> 00:36:58,005
I don't understand.
I mean, what can be so important

495
00:36:58,006 --> 00:36:59,006
that he just gets out in the
middle of the job ?

496
00:36:58,622 --> 00:37:00,389
Dean, what the hell is going on ?

497
00:37:03,861 --> 00:37:05,253
Sam, Sam !

498
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:13,070
Take me home.

499
00:37:17,737 --> 00:37:19,943
Take me home.

500
00:37:21,778 --> 00:37:22,560
No.

501
00:38:03,413 --> 00:38:04,664
Don't do this.

502
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:08,862
I can never go home.

503
00:38:11,902 --> 00:38:13,732
You're scared to go home.

504
00:38:20,746 --> 00:38:21,826
Hold me.

505
00:38:22,905 --> 00:38:25,362
I'm so cold.

506
00:38:25,773 --> 00:38:29,762
You can't kill me.
I'm not unfaithful.

507
00:38:29,997 --> 00:38:31,796
I've never been.

508
00:38:33,011 --> 00:38:34,075
You will be.

509
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,036
I'm taking you home.

510
00:39:22,507 --> 00:39:23,070
Sam !

511
00:39:34,156 --> 00:39:35,924
- Sam !
- Here !

512
00:39:35,971 --> 00:39:37,113
You okay ?

513
00:39:37,801 --> 00:39:38,677
I think.

514
00:39:39,272 --> 00:39:41,400
- Can you move ?
- Yeah. Help me.

515
00:40:42,779 --> 00:40:44,953
You've come home to us, mommy.

516
00:41:23,062 --> 00:41:25,033
So this is where she drowned her kids.

517
00:41:26,707 --> 00:41:28,178
That's why she could never go home.

518
00:41:29,969 --> 00:41:31,721
She was too scared to face them.

519
00:41:32,981 --> 00:41:34,561
You found her weak spot.

520
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,313
Nice work, Sammy.

521
00:41:38,899 --> 00:41:41,043
I wish I could say the same for you.

522
00:41:41,168 --> 00:41:43,461
What were you thinking
shooting Casper in the face, you freak ?

523
00:41:43,566 --> 00:41:46,070
Hey, saved your ass.

524
00:41:46,961 --> 00:41:49,981
I'll tell you another thing.
If you screwed up my car,

525
00:41:51,544 --> 00:41:52,764
I'll kill you.

526
00:42:05,337 --> 00:42:08,575
- Okay, here's where dad went.
- It's called Blackbottle Ridge, Colorado.

527
00:42:09,811 --> 00:42:11,579
Sounds charming.
How far ?

528
00:42:12,527 --> 00:42:14,388
About 600 miles.

529
00:42:15,092 --> 00:42:17,423
If we shag ass,
we can make it by morning.

530
00:42:19,312 --> 00:42:20,876
Dean, um...

531
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:24,490
You're not going.

532
00:42:24,631 --> 00:42:27,056
The interview's in 10 hours.
I got to be there.

533
00:42:31,872 --> 00:42:35,987
Yeah. Yeah, whatever.
I'll take you home.

534
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:58,067
You'll call me if you find him ?

535
00:43:01,075 --> 00:43:02,812
Maybe I can meet up with you later, huh ?

536
00:43:03,109 --> 00:43:03,969
Yeah, all right.

537
00:43:07,971 --> 00:43:08,753
Sam.

538
00:43:12,821 --> 00:43:14,573
You know, we made a hell of a team back there.

539
00:43:15,815 --> 00:43:16,409
Yeah.

540
00:43:35,664 --> 00:43:36,540
Jess !

541
00:43:38,418 --> 00:43:39,544
You home !?

542
00:44:21,683 --> 00:44:22,622
No !

543
00:44:25,568 --> 00:44:26,538
Sam !

544
00:44:26,569 --> 00:44:27,336
Jess !

545
00:44:29,088 --> 00:44:30,606
Sam ! Sam !

546
00:44:31,857 --> 00:44:33,656
No ! No !

547
00:44:34,573 --> 00:44:37,327
Jess !
Jess ! No !

548
00:45:23,328 --> 00:45:25,049
We got work to do.
